\section{Question 1}
Train and evaluate a Feedforward Neural Network for a  multiclass classification task.
%
Split your data into a training set, a validation set 
(used to define the stopping criterion - e.g., number of epochs), 
and a test set for the final evaluation of the model. 
%
The output layer should use one Softmax neuron per class, 
and the training objective should be theminimization of cross-entropy loss. 
%
Describe your dataset, the network architecture
(hidden units, layer dimensions, and number of layers), 
and discuss the overallperformance
(data splitting strategy, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix).
