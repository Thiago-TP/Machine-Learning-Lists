\section{Question 6}
Do your own implementation and train a multivariate linear regression model for a given problem 
(suggestions:  Kaggle, UCI Machine  Learning Repository). 
You may use a validation set to train models with different subsets of features and select the best one. 
Then, use a test set to report and comment the final model results.
