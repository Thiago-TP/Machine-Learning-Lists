\section{Question 5}
Consider the dataset of 3000 bivariate, labeled samples in \texttt{data.csv} file. 
Firstly, split thedataset into training (70\%) and test set (30\%).

\subsection{Item a}
Assume the samples labeled with ``$+1$'' are drawn by a bivariate gaussian density 
with parameters $\mu_{+1}$, $\Sigma_{+1}$, while the samples labeled with ``$-1$'' 
are drawn by another gaussiandensity with parameters $\mu_{-1}$, $\Sigma_{-1}$. 
The prior probabilities $P(C_{+1})$ and $P(C_{-1})$ are unknown as well. 
Estimate the missing parameters (with the training set), 
present the discriminantfunctions of the Bayes classifier (MAP criterion) 
and evaluate its performance(accuracy, precision, recall) over the test set.
Comment all your results.

\subsection{Item b}
Calculate the decision boundary and plot it on a graph with the samples of the test set.
Comment your results.
