\section{Question 4}

Assume you want to design a classifier which receives univariate data as input and must choose between class $+1$ or class $-1$.
The data associated with class ``$+1$'' follow a gaussian density with mean $2$ and unit variance. 
On the other hand, the data associated with class ``$-1$'' follow a uniform density between $-2$ and $2$. 
The prior probabilities are $P(C_{+1}) = 0.6$ and $P(C_{-1}) = 0.4$.

\subsection{Item a}
Apply Bayes' methodology to obtain the optimal classification model and show, using adiagram, 
the model's architecture (with clear indication of the discriminant function(s)).

\subsection{Item b}
Calculate the model's decision boundary. 
Analytically calculate the classifier error probability (the integrals can be numerically solved).

\subsection{Item c}
Recalculate the model's decision boundary if the Maximum-Likelihood criterion is adopted, this time. 
Analytically calculate the classifier error probability (the integrals can be numerically solved).

\subsection{Item d}
Compare the performances of both methodologies.
