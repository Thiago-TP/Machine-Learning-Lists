\section{Question 1}

$X$ is a continuous-valued random variable with uniform density in $(-1, +1)$. 

\subsection{Item a}
Draw its probability density function. What is the area under the curve? Justify your answer.

\subsection{Item b}
Draw its cumulative distribution function.

\subsection{Item c}
Calculate the probability of the event $X\in(-0.2, 0.2)$.

\subsection{Item d}
Calculate the expected value $\E[X]$, 
the second $\E[X^2]$ and the fourth moment $\E[X^4]$ of the random variable. 
Calculate its variance $\var[X]$, as well.
