\section{Question 1}

$X$ is a continuous-valued random variable with uniform density in $(-1, +1)$. 

\subsection{Item a}
Draw its probability density function (PDF). What is the area under the curve? Justify your answer.

\subsection{Item b}
Draw its cumulative distribution function (CDF).

\subsection{Item c}
Calculate the probability of the event $X\in(-0.2, 0.2)$.

\subsection{Item d}
Calculate the expected value $\E[X]$, 
the second $\E[X^2]$ and the fourth moment $\E[X^4]$ of the random variable. 
Calculate its variance $\var[X]$, as well.

Let $p: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ denote the PDF of $X$ 
and $c: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ its CDF.
Since the random variable is of uniform density in $(-1, +1)$, 
%
\begin{equation}
    p(x) = \begin{cases}
        k, & |x| < 1 \\
        0, & |x| \geq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
for some constant $k > 0$.
%
By definition, the area under the PDF curve is equal to the probability $P$ of $X$ assuming a value in the associated range $(a, b)$,
$P(a < X < b) = \int_a^b p(x) \ dx$.
%
For $a=-\infty$ and $b=\infty$,
$P(-\infty < X < \infty) = 1$, i.e., the probability of $X$ assuming \textit{any} value is 100\%.
We can use this result (in general, an identity) to find the value of $k$:
%
\begin{align}
    P(-\infty < X < \infty) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p(x) \ dx = 1 
    \implies
    \int_{|x| \geq 1} p(x) \ dx + 
    \int_{|x| < 1} p(x) \ dx & = 1
    \\
    \int_{|x| \geq 1} 0 \ dx + 
    \int_{|x| < 1} k \ dx & = 1
    \\
    2k &= 1 \quad\therefore\quad 
    k = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align}

With $k$ evaluated, we can find any $P$, e.g., 
$P(-0.2 < X < 0.2) = [0.2-(-0.2)] \cdot (1/2) = 0.2$.
A drawing of $p(x)$ and $c(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x p(z)\ dz$ is presented in \cref{fig:pdf-cdf}.

Next, the variance and some of the moments of $p$ is calculated.
By definition, 
$\E[X^n] = \int_\mathbb{R} x^n p(x)\ dx$. 
For this question's distribution,
%
\begin{align}
    \E[X^n] = \int_{-1}^1 x^n \cdot \frac{1}{2}\ dx
    = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\bigg|_{x=-1}^{x=1}
    = \frac{1 + (-1)^n}{2(n+1)}
    = \begin{cases} 
        0, & n \text{ odd}\\
        1/(n+1), & n \text{ even}
    \end{cases}
\end{align} 

The above expression gives, for example, 
$\E[X]=0$, $\E[X^2]=1/3$, and $\E[X^4]=1/5$.
% 
As for the variance, the definition
$\var[X] = \E[(X - \E[X])^2] 
         = \E[X^2] - \E[X]^2$ 
results in $\var[X] = 1/3$.
